Purpose
The Tamagotchi app is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to quickly and easily perform actions to take care of their pet. The app's color scheme and graphics are also carefully chosen to be visually appealing and engaging to users, with a soothing and calming effect that can help reduce stress and anxiety.
The app's core functionality is built around three key metrics: hunger, cleanliness, and health. These metrics are represented by progress bars that decrease over time, indicating the pet's current state. Users can perform specific actions to increase these progress bars and keep their pet healthy and happy.
For example, users can feed their pet by clicking on the "Feed" button, which will increase the pet's hunger progress bar and also change the pet's image to reflect its fuller state. Similarly, users can play with their pet by clicking on the "Play" button, which will increase the pet's happiness and also change its image to reflect its more playful state.
The app also includes a "Clean" button, which allows users to clean up after their pet and maintain a clean and healthy environment. This button will increase the pet's cleanliness progress bar and also change the pet's image to reflect its cleaner state.
In addition to these core metrics, the app also includes a "Health" meter that tracks the pet's overall health and well-being. This meter is affected by the pet's hunger, cleanliness, and happiness levels, and will decrease if any of these metrics fall too low. If the health meter reaches zero, the pet will become sick and may eventually die, requiring the user to start over with a new pet.
Overall, the Tamagotchi app is a fun and engaging way for users to experience the responsibility and joy of taking care of a pet, without the real-world commitments and responsibilities. The app's user-friendly interface, visually appealing graphics, and core metrics of hunger, cleanliness, and health make it a unique and rewarding experience for users of all ages.

 Design Considerations
The Tamagotchi app's design also takes into account accessibility for users with disabilities. The app includes large, easy-to-read text and clear, high-contrast graphics that are optimized for users with visual impairments. The app's buttons and controls are also designed to be easy to use for users with motor impairments, with large touch targets and clear feedback on button presses.
 In addition to the core metrics of hunger, cleanliness, and health, the app also includes a variety of mini-games and activities that users can play with their pet to further increase its happiness and well-being. These mini-games are designed to be fun and engaging, while also providing users with a sense of accomplishment and progress.

The app also includes a notification system that alerts users when their pet's hunger, cleanliness, or health levels are low, allowing them to quickly and easily perform the necessary actions to take care of their pet. This notification system can be customized to fit the user's preferences, with options for frequency and type of notifications.
Overall, the Tamagotchi app's design and functionality are focused on simplicity, ease of use, and accessibility, with a user-friendly interface, visually appealing graphics, and core metrics of hunger, cleanliness, and health. The app's mini-games and notification system provide additional depth and engagement, making it a fun and rewarding experience for users of all ages and abilities.

GitHub and GitHub Actions
The app's source code is hosted on GitHub, a popular version control and collaboration platform. GitHub Actions, a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool, is used to automate the build, test, and deployment process for the app.
The GitHub Actions workflow for the app includes the following steps:
⦁	Checkout the app's source code from the GitHub repository.
⦁	Build the app using Gradle, a build automation tool for Android.
⦁	Run unit tests to ensure the app's functionality is working as expected.
⦁	Generate a release artifact, which includes the app's APK file and any other necessary files for deployment.
⦁	Publish the release artifact to the GitHub repository's Releases page.
By using GitHub Actions, the app's development team can ensure that the app is built and tested consistently, reducing the risk of errors and bugs in the final product. Additionally, the automated deployment process saves time and effort, allowing the team to focus on other aspects of app development.
In conclusion, the Tamagotchi app is a fun and engaging digital pet simulation game that provides users with a unique and rewarding experience. The app's design and functionality are built around simplicity and ease of use, with a focus on core metrics such as hunger, cleanliness, and health. The use of GitHub and GitHub Actions for version control and automation ensures a consistent and reliable development process, reducing the risk of errors and bugs in the final product.
